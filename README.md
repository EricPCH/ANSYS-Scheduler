# AEDT Scheduler

This project contains a small IronPython script that provides a GUI for
managing a simulation queue.  Users can add files to the queue, reorder or
remove them and then start a simple simulation process.  Finished items are
moved to a separate list so you can track what has been processed.

Only `.aedt` or `.aedtz` files can be added to the queue. Run `run.bat` to
start the application in an Ansys IronPython environment.
